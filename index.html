                    <li><strong>Soil Data Management:</strong> Key: GPS coordinates or field ID. Value: Soil properties (e.g., pH, moisture, nutrient levels).</li>
                    <li><strong>Crop Records:</strong> Key: Crop ID or type. Value: Growth details, yield history, and optimal conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Sensor Data:</strong> Key: Sensor ID or location. Value: Data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture).</li>
                    <li><strong>Farm Equipment Tracking:</strong> Key: Equipment ID or type. Value: Maintenance schedules, usage history, or availability status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> Key: Date or time stamp. Value: Recorded weather parameters (e.g., rainfall, temperature).</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Data and Pricing:</strong> Key: Crop type or market name. Value: Current prices, historical price trends, and demand forecasts.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Mapping to SDG Targets:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SDG 1: No Poverty</strong> (Target 1.1): Eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere. Farm Data Management helps increase farm productivity and incomes, reducing poverty in rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</strong> (Target 2.3): Double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers. Farm Data Management tools like crop yield prediction improve resource use and boost productivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> (Target 12.3): Halve per capita global food waste. Better farm-to-market tracking reduces food losses and waste, enhancing food security.</li>
                </ul>
