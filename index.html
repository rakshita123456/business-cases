            <!-- Farm Data Management -->
            <div class="case">
                <h3>1. Farm Data Management üåæüìä</h3>
                <p>Manage farm details such as soil quality, crop type, and yield history.</p>
                
                <h4>Soil Quality:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Monitoring nutrient levels, pH balance, and organic matter in the soil.</li>
                    <li>Tracking changes over time to maintain soil health and fertility.</li>
                    <li>Supporting decisions about crop rotation, fertilization, and land use.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Crop Types:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Keeping records of planted crops, including their varieties and characteristics.</li>
                    <li>Managing data on growth cycles, optimal planting and harvesting times, and water or nutrient needs.</li>
                    <li>Aligning crop selection with market demand and environmental conditions.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Yield History:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Recording historical data on crop yields to evaluate farm performance.</li>
                    <li>Identifying patterns or trends to improve future yield predictions.</li>
                    <li>Assessing the impact of farming techniques, weather, and inputs on productivity.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Portable Tools: Hash Tables</h4>
                <p>Hash Tables are a fundamental data structure widely used to store and retrieve information efficiently. They allow quick access to specific data points, making them ideal for handling the large volumes of information generated in agricultural processes.</p>
                
                <h4>Applications of Hash Tables in Farm Data Management:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Soil Data Management:</strong> Key: GPS coordinates or field ID. Value: Soil properties (e.g., pH, moisture, nutrient levels).</li>
                    <li><strong>Crop Records:</strong> Key: Crop ID or type. Value: Growth details, yield history, and optimal conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-Time Sensor Data:</strong> Key: Sensor ID or location. Value: Data from sensors (e.g., temperature, humidity, soil moisture).</li>
                    <li><strong>Farm Equipment Tracking:</strong> Key: Equipment ID or type. Value: Maintenance schedules, usage history, or availability status.</li>
                    <li><strong>Weather Data:</strong> Key: Date or time stamp. Value: Recorded weather parameters (e.g., rainfall, temperature).</li>
                    <li><strong>Market Data and Pricing:</strong> Key: Crop type or market name. Value: Current prices, historical price trends, and demand forecasts.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1>Reasons for Using Hash Table in Farm Data Management</h1>
    
    <div class="container">
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fast Lookup (<span class="highlight">O(1)</span> Average Case):</strong> Provides quick access to farm data by using unique keys (like farm names or IDs), ensuring efficient searches even with large datasets.</li>
            <li><strong>Efficient Insertion and Deletion (<span class="highlight">O(1)</span> Average Case):</strong> Inserting or deleting farm data is fast since hash tables don't require reordering elements, making it ideal for dynamic data.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Hash tables handle large datasets efficiently without significant performance degradation, making them well-suited for growing farm data.</li>
            <li><strong>Collision Handling:</strong> Hash tables can handle collisions (when two farms hash to the same slot) effectively using methods like chaining or open addressing, ensuring data consistency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

                <h4>Mapping to SDG Targets:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SDG 1: No Poverty</strong> (Target 1.1): Eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere. Farm Data Management helps increase farm productivity and incomes, reducing poverty in rural areas.</li>
                    <li><strong>SDG 2: Zero Hunger</strong> (Target 2.3): Double the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers. Farm Data Management tools like crop yield prediction improve resource use and boost productivity.</li>
                    <li><strong>SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production</strong> (Target 12.3): Halve per capita global food waste. Better farm-to-market tracking reduces food losses and waste, enhancing food security.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Farmer Marketplace -->
            <div class="case">
                <h3>2. Farmer Marketplace üõíüå±</h3>
                <p>Enable farmers to sell directly, maintaining a list of products and their details. The platform allows farmers to manage a comprehensive product list, including type, quantity, price, quality grade, and availability. Buyers can easily browse, search, and purchase, fostering trust between both parties.</p>
                
                <h4>Key Features:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Product Management:</strong> Farmers can add, update, or remove products from their inventory, including crop type, harvest date, and pricing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Search and Filter Options:</strong> Buyers can search for specific products or filter by location, price, or quality grade.</li>
                    <li><strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Mechanisms for quality verification, certifications, or grading of produce.</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure Transactions:</strong> Integrated payment systems support multiple payment options like UPI, credit/debit cards, or cash on delivery.</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Portable Tools: Arrays and Stacks</h4>
                <p>Arrays and stacks are straightforward to implement for basic operations. Arrays provide efficient access and updates, while stacks manage recent actions effectively. Works well for small to medium-sized marketplaces.</p>
                
                <h4>Applications:</h4>
